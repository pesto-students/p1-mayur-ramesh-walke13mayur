GENERAL DESIGN:
1.Extend ground markings for cycle lanes through the conflict zone of the intersection, matching the width and positioning of the leading cycle lanes. Manage turns across the cycle track using a leading cycle/lagging left-turn phase.
2.Where transit is in mixed traffic on the two-way street, avoid conflicts at transit stops by raising cycle lanes and changing markings. This helps to reduce cycling speeds and provide at-grade access to transit passengers. In such a configuration, cyclists must yield to
pedestrians.
3.On the one-way street, create pedestrian refuge islands in line with the parking lane to reduce pedestrian crossing distance. Where geometry allows, install refuge islands.
4.Bus bulbs provide a dedicated space for passengers to wait, improving transit travel times with more efficient boarding. Far-side transit stops are preferred in conditions in which conflicts with turning vehicles are common.
5.Provide turn lanes by introducing a recessed central median on the two-way street. Turn lanes provide protected turns across oncoming traffic.

RULES:
	1. Traffic signal time for north-south will be double as compared to east-west side (assuming it to be majority of school and office people using north-south road).
	2. One way traffic from 7 AM to 7 pm to maximize the efficiency of road.

AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT:
	1. For future aspect leave space for flyover column and metro pillars.
